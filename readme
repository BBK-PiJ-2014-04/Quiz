The serverLauncher class starts the Server program.
When that one is up and running, run the CreatorProgram class to start the Quiz Creator.
When the interface is running, it is quite intuitive, I tried to add as many guidelines as possible (also set validation),
Now the PlayerProgram class can be started to start the Quiz Player client.

If the PlayerProgram is started before the Creator one or no Quiz have been created, the only thing it will allow the user to do is to create a login.
After you create a user in either clients, it is going to be available for both playing and creating. 
A user won't be able to play its own quiz. Also, he will be able to attempt a quiz just one time.

The PlayerProgram interface is very simple and intuitive too, it shouldn't be too complicated to use it.

Possible Exceptions
Sometimes a denial of connect is thrown, but that's really random and hasn't happened for a while now.
