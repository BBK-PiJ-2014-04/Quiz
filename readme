The serverLauncher class starts the Server program.
When that one is up and running, run the CreatorProgram class to start the Quiz Creator.
When the interface is running, it is quite self-explicative, I tried to add as many guidelines as possible (also set validation),
It isn't perfectly accurate (quiz with the same name can be created) but the program as a whole seems to be working fine.
I'm going to run tests on this part ASAP and start the actual game part (even though I'll keep it as simple as possible).
Sometimes a denial of connect is thrown, but that's really random.
