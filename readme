The serverLauncher class starts the Server program.
When that one is up and running, the CreatorClientImpl class can be run 
and this represent the actual interface of the program (I might put the actual interface (main method) on another file, but at the moment I'll leave it like this)
When the interface is running, it is quite self-explicative, I tried to add as many guidelines as possible (also set validation),
It isn't perfectly accurate (and still has bug as the 04/05/2015) but the program as a whole it seems to be working fine.
I'm going to run tests on this part ASAP and start the actual game part (even though I'll keep it as simple as possible).
