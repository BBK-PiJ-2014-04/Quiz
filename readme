The serverLauncher class starts the Server program.
When that one is up and running, run the CreatorProgram class to start the Quiz Creator.
When the interface is running, it is quite self-explicative, I tried to add as many guidelines as possible (also set validation),


The creator part has been tested and works now fine.
The playing part has been started and the Server part is completed. The interface isn't present yet.


Possible Exceptions
Sometimes a denial of connect is thrown, but that's really random.
